**Share some interesting or excellent algorithm from Leet-Code**

As for the file structure, a pdf file is enough for reading, for you can get the problem description from the hyperlink at the top of pdf file.
But if you need source files, you can go to */Leet-Code/Source-File* to get them.
Another thing you should notice is that if you open some pdf files failed and reloading is useless, please try to download them to read.

There are always some problems that are difficult but can be solved in multiple ways. 
Many of them are thinking at a completely different point, sometimes associated with number theory and game theory, and sometimes is just a brain teaser.  

So I think it's worthy writing down them, I will collect my code and some solutions from others (give references).  
My preferred language is C++11, sometimes Python3 or Java8.

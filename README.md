Share some interesting or excellent algorithm from Leet-Code

There are always some problems that are difficult but can be solved in multiple ways.  
Many of them are thinking at a completely different point, sometimes associated with number theory and game theory, and sometimes is just a brain teaser.  

So I think it's worthy writing down them, and I will collect my code and some solutions from others (give references).  
My preferred language is C++11, sometimes python3 or java8.
